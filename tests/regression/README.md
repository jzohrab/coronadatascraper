# Regression testing

Work-in-progress

Goal: routine to get latest cache date, then run yarn start offline for all scrapers, and yarn timeseries.  Store in some folder.  Check out other hash and do the same, store in different folder.  Diff the files in the folders.  Maybe commit the files for regression data sets.
